### Insertion Sort

**Insertion sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on *large* lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance	O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Best case performance	O(n)
* Average case performance	O(n<sup>2</sup>)



### Merge Sort

**Merge sort** (also commonly spelled *mergesort*) is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

__Properties__
* Worst case performance	O(n log n)
* Best case performance	O(n log n)
* Average case performance	O(n log n)
