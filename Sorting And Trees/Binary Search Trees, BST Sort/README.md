# Binary Search Trees, BST Sort
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

Time complexity in big O notation

Algorithm----Average---Worst case

Space	--------O(n)-------O(n)

Search--------O(log n)---O(n)

Insert--------O(log n)---O(n)

Delete--------O(log n)---O(n)
