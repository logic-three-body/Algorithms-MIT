### Heap
A heap is a tree-based data structure in which all the nodes of the tree are in a specific order.

For example, if X is the parent node of Y, then the value of X follows a specific order with respect to the value of Y and the same order will be followed across the tree.

### Priority Queues
In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type similar to regular queue or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with low priority.

**Heapsort** is a _comparison-based_ sorting algorithm. It can be thought of as an improved selection sort. It divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region.
