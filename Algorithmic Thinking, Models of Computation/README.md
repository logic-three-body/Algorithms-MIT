## Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding
For a given structure of data find a peak(if it exists)

Peak is defined as the element which is greater than or equal to the neighbors 

1D Version - Given an array of n integers, find a peak(i.e. element which is NOT smaller than its neighbours)

2D Version - Given an m x n matrix of integers, find a peak(i.e. element which is NOT smaller than its neighbours)
